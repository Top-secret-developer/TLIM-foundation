I am a passionate and driven individual with a strong interest in human resource management and people development. I have a background in Political Science, and I am committed to building a meaningful career that allows me to empower others through structured systems and compassionate leadership. My journey into HR began during my NYSC year in 2021, where I worked as an HR intern in a facility management company. Thereafter, I interned at Transcorp Hilton Abuja, where I participated in the Careers@Hilton program in partnership with&nbsp;ACE&nbsp;Charity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\"><strong>What was your life like before joining the Career@Hilton program, and what motivated you to participate?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\">Before joining the Careers@Hilton program, I was searching for a clear path to continue my HR career because it actually piqued my interest. After my Service year, I got another job as a business development officer in a finance company where I worked for about 7 months. I knew deep down that was not my career path and I knew I had to get back into Human Resource Management. And like many young people, I had the passion but lacked the professional experience and mentorship to break into the corporate world of HR. I was motivated to participate in the program because it presented a rare opportunity to gain firsthand exposure to a world-class hospitality environment, while learning from experienced professionals. I also admired Hilton\u2019s global reputation for nurturing young talent, and I saw it as a platform to kickstart something&nbsp;meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\"><strong>What key skills or experiences did you gain from the program that helped shape your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\">The program equipped me with both technical and soft skills that are vital in the HR profession. I took on more than 14 HR related courses in just two weeks and actually won \u201cThe BlueEnergy Award\u201d for it. During my time in the HR department, I basically job shadowed the various Managers in each HR unit where I gained hands-on experience in recruitment processes, onboarding, employee engagement and relations, learning and development and basic HR administration. I learned the importance of confidentiality, attention to detail, and communication skills that have become the foundation of my professional identity. The exposure to Hilton\u2019s core values of hospitality, integrity, and teamwork also helped me understand what it means to work in a people-centered&nbsp;environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1423-1024x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1423-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1423-300x117.jpg 300w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1423-768x300.jpg 768w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1423.jpg 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\"><strong>How did the program influence your journey to becoming an HR professional, and what challenges did you overcome along the way?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\">The Careers@Hilton program was a turning point for me. It not only confirmed my passion for HR but also gave me the confidence to pursue it professionally. Like many new interns, I initially struggled with self-doubt and adjusting to a fast-paced corporate environment. But with the guidance of my supervisors and the inclusive culture at Hilton, I gradually found my voice and learned to take initiative. Overcoming those early challenges made me more resilient and affirmed that I belong in&nbsp;the&nbsp;HR&nbsp;space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"646\" src=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1424-1024x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1424-1024x646.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1424-300x189.jpg 300w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1424-768x484.jpg 768w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1424.jpg 1175w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\"><strong>How has your life changed since completing the program, both professionally and personally?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\">Professionally, the program opened doors I never imagined. It also gave me credibility, real-world experience, and a network of mentors and peers who continue to support my growth. I have worked in reputable hospitality organizations. I worked as a Human Resource Manager in 3Js Hotels and Apartment for 1 year and 3 months and I am currently working in a 5-star hotel, Johnwood Hotel as their Human Resource Officer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"698\" src=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1425-1024x698.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1425-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1425-300x204.jpg 300w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1425-768x523.jpg 768w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1425.jpg 1202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\">Personally, I have become more confident, disciplined, and purpose driven. I now approach opportunities with a sense of readiness and optimism, knowing that I have been trained by one of the best hospitality brands in the world. The experience helped shape not just my career but also my mindset&nbsp;and&nbsp;self-worth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\"><strong>What advice would you give to other young people who are thinking of joining an empowerment program like this?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\" style=\"padding-top:12px;padding-right:12px;padding-bottom:12px;padding-left:12px;line-height:1.6\">I would say\u2014go for it! Opportunities like the Careers@Hilton program can be life-changing. Don\u2019t let fear or inexperience hold you back. Be open to learning, stay curious, and give your best every day. Even if you start small, the experience and connections you gain can pave the way for a successful future. Empowerment programs are not just about jobs\u2014they\u2019re about discovering who you are and what you\u2019re capable&nbsp;of&nbsp;becoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1426-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1426-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1426-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1426-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/acecharityafrica.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/IMG_1426.jpg 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How the Career@Hilton Program Launched Edidiong\u2019s HR Career Meet Edidiong Christopher Edet, a standout alumna of the&nbsp;Careers@Hilton&nbsp;program in partnership with Transcorp Hilton Abuja.
