He gave me the information two days to the close of the application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How did you feel when you were called for the interview?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was elated! After receiving the message from ACE Charity, I called my friend to check if he got called as well but unfortunately, he did not. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>How was the interview experience?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought I was prepared for the interview but some of the questions threw me off. I was so sure I was unsuccessful because unlike others, my interview was ridiculously short. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How was the internship experience?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The internship was exciting. We had morning sessions which involved relevant presentations and motivational talks from different guest speakers. I also \u00a0learnt a lot from the ACE staff, they were pivotal in facilitating the internship process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How did you end the programme?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After three (3) productively intense weeks, the programme ended on a high note. We had a very nice graduation ceremony, the General Manager and most top management staff of the Transcorp Hilton, were there to celebrate with us. Though I did not win the best performing intern, I left with so much more than I started with. I learnt that contrary to what I thought, Hospitality business is not stereotypical to one aspect of discipline, it is multi-faceted.<\/span><br \/>\n<b>[FinalTilesGallery id=&#8217;1&#8242;]<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Did you learn any relevant career skills?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most definitely! I learnt a variety of skills particularly communication, leadership and interpersonal relations and customer relationship management. I also learned to give detailed reports which has come in useful in my current role as an ACE Charity Resource Staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What advice do you have for other young people hoping to participate in the careers at Hilton program?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The facilitators are nice but strict! (laughs). I will advise them to come unassuming so that their learning is not hindered <\/span>in any way. They should also know that the duration of the internship will go by very quickly meaning they should seize every opportunity to learn and network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kayode applied for the careers at Hilton programme.
