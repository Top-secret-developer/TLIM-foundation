For this study, qualitative data was used, employing purposive sampling as a method for selecting the participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The responses were collected using a remote data collection tool over a three month period and were subsequently analysed thematically. A total of 35 respondents were sampled and these respondents were adolescent boys in Northern Nigeria, between ages 10 and 18 who were out-of-school and were also listeners of the ACE Radio School lessons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Findings from this study revealed seven major reasons for the number of out-of-school boys in Northern Nigeria while citing other less prominent, but note-worthy reasons. Also, the experiences the boys had with ACE Radio school affirms that this remote method of teaching, using both the radio and mother tongue, made ACE Radio School a good alternative for delivering high quality educational content to out-of-school boys, and girls alike, in Northern Nigeria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read full paper: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ijsrp.org\/research-paper-1222\/ijsrp-p13214.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.ijsrp.org\/research-paper-1222\/ijsrp-p13214.pdf<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During the Coronavirus Pandemic, schools across the world were forced to close down spurring them to embrace innovative means of delivering lessons to students.
